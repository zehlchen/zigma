# Zehl's Enigma Machine (2.0)
The **ZIGMA** (*ZEHL+ENIGMA*) program allows users to create "cryptograms" suitable for use on public 
networks and platforms such as social media, popular chat and forum software, email and SMS messages, 
and even scannable QR-codes. **ZIGMA** attempts to provide enough security for those with clinical
paranoia and has been written and designed to be an extensible, maintainable, and portable software
solution.
